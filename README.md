This is an implementation of the [HAPPILEE pipeline](https://www.plasticityinneurodevelopmentlab.com/happilee-lowdensity-eeg) for the [Explore system](https://github.com/Mentalab-hub/explorepy) from Mentalab.

HAPPILEE is applied to EEG data recorded by the Explore system in `happilee.ipynb`.
This method is applied on different artifacts in `testing.ipynb`.

Noise removal is applied in real time to the data stream from the Explore device in `acquisition_example.py`.
